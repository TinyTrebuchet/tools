How to create classes in C

<header file>
typedef struct _GtkPrintJob GtkPrintJob

<source file>
struct _GtkPrintJob {
	all class private attributes
}

typedef struct _GtkPrintJobClass GtkPrintJobClass
struct _GtkPrintJobClass {
	all class functions, including functions to get/access private attributes
}



void my_class_name_class_init () -> executed once per class, before first instance is created, intializes a class

void my_class_name_init() -> executed for every instance, initializes an instance of a class


eg:

gtk_print_job_class_init (GtkPrintJobClass *class)
{
	GObjectClass *object_class;
	object_class = (GObjectClass *) class;
	
	object_class->finalize = gtk_print_job_finalize;
	object_class->constructed = gtk_print_job_constructed;
	object_class->set_property = gtk_print_job_set_property;
	object_class->get_property = gtk_print_job_get_property;
